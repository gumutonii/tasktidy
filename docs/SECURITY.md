## DevSecOps Integration

### 1. Code Security Scanning

**Tool**: Trivy Vulnerability Scanner
**Frequency**: Every commit and pull request
**Scope**: Full codebase analysis

**Configuration**:
```yaml
security-scan:
  tool: trivy
  scan-type: fs
  severity: CRITICAL,HIGH
  format: sarif
  output: trivy-results.sarif
```

**Security Gates**:
- ❌ Block deployment if CRITICAL vulnerabilities detected
- ⚠️ Warn on HIGH severity vulnerabilities
- ✅ Allow deployment for MEDIUM/LOW severity

**Integration**:
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Automated vulnerability reporting
- Security team notifications

### 2. Container Security Scanning

**Tool**: Trivy Container Scanner
**Target**: Built Docker images
**Coverage**: OS packages, dependencies, configuration

**Scan Process**:
1. **Image Analysis**: Scan for known vulnerabilities
2. **Configuration Review**: Check Dockerfile security
3. **Base Image Audit**: Verify base image security
4. **Dependency Check**: Scan application dependencies

**Security Gates**:
- ❌ Block deployment if critical container vulnerabilities
- ⚠️ Require manual approval for high severity
- ✅ Automated deployment for low/medium severity

### 3. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

**Tool**: npm audit
**Coverage**: All Node.js dependencies
**Frequency**: Every build

**Backend Dependencies**:
```bash
cd backend
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

**Frontend Dependencies**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

**Vulnerability Levels**:
- **Critical**: Immediate action required
- **High**: Update within 24 hours
- **Moderate**: Update within 1 week
- **Low**: Update within 1 month

### 2. Container Security

**Dockerfile Best Practices**:
```dockerfile
# Use specific base image versions
FROM node:18-alpine

# Run as non-root user
USER node

# Copy only necessary files
COPY --chown=node:node package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=node:node . .

# Expose minimal ports
EXPOSE 5000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/health || exit 1
```

**Security Measures**:
- Non-root user execution
