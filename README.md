For detailed pipeline documentation, see [CI/CD Pipeline Documentation](docs/CI-CD-PIPELINE.md).

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gumutonii/tasktidy.git
cd tasktidy
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Create `.env` files in both `backend/` and `frontend/` directories.

**backend/.env**
```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://tasktidy-frontend-gumutoni.azurewebsites.net
```

**frontend/.env**
```
VITE_API_URL=https://tasktidy-backend-gumutoni.azurewebsites.net
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 3. Run locally with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
```bash
# for production
- Frontend: [http://localhost:5713](http://localhost:5713)
- Backend: [http://localhost:5000/api](http://localhost:5000/api)
```

## Environment Variables

**Backend**
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `PORT`: Port for Express server (default: 5000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production)
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret for JWT authentication
- `FRONTEND_URL`: URL of the frontend (for CORS)

**Frontend**
- `VITE_API_URL`: URL of the backend API 
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production)

> **Note:** In Azure App Service, set these variables in the App Service Configuration, not in `.env` files.

---

## Deployment

### 1. Build and Push Docker Images

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
docker build -t yourdockerhub/tasktidy-backend:latest .
docker push yourdockerhub/tasktidy-backend:latest

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
docker build -t yourdockerhub/tasktidy-frontend:latest .
docker push yourdockerhub/tasktidy-frontend:latest
```

### 2. Provision Azure Infrastructure with Terraform

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### 3. Restart Azure App Services (if needed)

```bash
az webapp restart --name tasktidy-backend-gumutoni --resource-group tasktidy-devops
az webapp restart --name tasktidy-frontend-gumutoni --resource-group tasktidy-devops
```

---

## Terraform Usage

- All Terraform state and sensitive files are excluded via `.gitignore`.
- Update environment variables in `main.tf` as needed.
- Outputs will provide the deployed URLs for frontend and backend.

---

## Docker Usage

- Both frontend and backend are multi-stage Docker builds.
- The frontend is served via Nginx on port 80 (required for Azure).
- The backend exposes port 5000.

---

## Monitoring & Operations

### Health Monitoring

The application includes comprehensive health monitoring:

- **Backend Health Endpoint**: `https://tasktidy-backend-gumutoni.azurewebsites.net/api/health`
- **Frontend Health Check**: `https://tasktidy-frontend-gumutoni.azurewebsites.net`
- **Automated Health Checks**: 30-second intervals
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting

### Monitoring Dashboard

A comprehensive monitoring dashboard is configured with:

- Application health status
- Performance metrics (response time, throughput, error rates)
- Infrastructure status (Azure App Service, database, containers)
- Security alerts and vulnerability tracking

For detailed monitoring documentation, see [Monitoring Documentation](docs/MONITORING.md).

## Security

### DevSecOps Integration

The application implements comprehensive security practices:

- **Automated Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanner for code and containers
- **Dependency Auditing**: npm audit for vulnerability detection
- **Security Gates**: Automated blocking of vulnerable deployments
- **Container Security**: Multi-layer security scanning
- **Compliance**: OWASP Top 10 compliance and security best practices

### Security Features

- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Regular security updates and vulnerability patching

For detailed security documentation, see [Security Documentation](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Frontend "Application Error"**: Ensure the Dockerfile exposes port 80 and the Nginx config does not proxy to a Docker network host.
- **Backend MongoDB Timeout**: Make sure your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from Azure App Service IPs or `0.0.0.0/0` for testing.
- **CORS Issues**: Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` is set correctly in backend environment variables.
- **Environment Variables Not Working**: In Azure, set them in the App Service Configuration, not in `.env` files.
- **Container Not Updating**: Restart the App Service after pushing a new Docker image.

### CI/CD Pipeline Issues

- **Security Scan Failures**: Check Trivy scan results in GitHub Security tab and update vulnerable dependencies
- **Build Failures**: Verify Node.js version compatibility and dependency installation
- **Deployment Failures**: Check Azure credentials and App Service configuration
- **Health Check Failures**: Verify application startup and database connectivity

### Monitoring and Alerting

- **High Error Rates**: Check application logs and database connectivity
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor resource utilization and optimize queries
- **Security Alerts**: Review vulnerability reports and update dependencies
- **Service Outages**: Check Azure App Service status and container health
